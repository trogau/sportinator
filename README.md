# [Sportinator Theme](https://trog.qgl.org/)

WARNING: this is a work-in-progress and is almost certainly broken due to age and plugin dependencies dying of old age. 

## Overview

Sportinator is a simple WordPress theme for collecting basic attendance details for events. For example, if you're organising a pickup game of soccer and want to know how many people can make it, you can direct your players to a Sportinator site and have them indicate whether or not they're coming, so you have an idea of numbers. 


### Dependencies

The theme currently depends on several plugins which are now obsolete and need to be replaced:
